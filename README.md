# SQL Injection Vulnerability Scanner Roadmap

This project aims to develop a web-based SQL injection vulnerability scanner to identify and mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. Below is the roadmap detailing the steps involved in building the scanner.

## Project Setup
- **Objective:** Set up the development environment and project structure.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Choose the programming languages for frontend and backend.
  - [ ] Create a new project directory.
  - [ ] Initialize version control (e.g., Git) to track changes.
  - [ ] Set up a virtual environment (if using Python).
  - [ ] Install necessary dependencies (e.g., Flask, Ruby on Rails).

## Frontend Development
- **Objective:** Create a user-friendly interface for the SQL injection scanner.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Design wireframes and user interface mockups.
  - [ ] Implement HTML structure for web pages.
  - [ ] Style web pages using CSS for a visually appealing design.
  - [ ] Add hover effects and animations to enhance user experience.
  - [ ] Implement interactivity using JavaScript for form validation and user input handling.

## Backend Development
- **Objective:** Implement the core logic for scanning websites for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Choose the backend language (e.g., Python with Flask, Ruby with Ruby on Rails).
  - [ ] Set up routes and controllers to handle HTTP requests.
  - [ ] Implement SQL injection detection algorithms using predefined payloads.
  - [ ] Integrate database connectivity if necessary (e.g., SQLite for storing scan results).
  - [ ] Develop functionality for generating scan reports in HTML format.

### SQL Injection Detection Logic
- Boolean-based Blind SQL Injection
- Time-based Blind SQL Injection
- Error-based SQL Injection
- UNION Query-based SQL Injection
- Stacked Queries SQL Injection
- Out-of-Band SQL Injection

## Integration
- **Objective:** Integrate the frontend and backend components to create a cohesive web application.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Connect the frontend UI with backend endpoints using AJAX requests.
  - [ ] Test the communication between frontend and backend using sample data.
  - [ ] Debug and resolve any integration issues that arise.

## Testing
- **Objective:** Ensure the SQL injection scanner functions correctly and reliably.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Write unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components.
  - [ ] Perform integration testing to validate the interaction between frontend and backend.
  - [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing to simulate user interactions and scan real websites for vulnerabilities.

## Documentation
- **Objective:** Provide comprehensive documentation to aid understanding and usage of the SQL injection scanner.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Write installation and setup instructions.
  - [ ] Document the architecture, design decisions, and implementation details.
  - [ ] Include guidelines for contributing to the project.
  - [ ] Add detailed descriptions for each task in the roadmap.

## Deployment
- **Objective:** Make the SQL injection scanner available for use by stakeholders.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) for deployment.
  - [ ] Set up deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
  - [ ] Configure continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
  - [ ] Deploy the application to the chosen hosting platform and ensure it is accessible.

## Maintenance and Updates
- **Objective:** Ensure the SQL injection scanner remains functional and up-to-date over time.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Monitor and address performance issues or bugs reported by users.
  - [ ] Implement new features or improvements based on user feedback.
  - [ ] Keep dependencies and libraries updated to prevent security vulnerabilities.
  - [ ] Regularly review and update documentation to reflect changes and improvements.

---

**Stack:**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python (Flask), Ruby (Ruby on Rails)

**Note:** Each task in the roadmap may require specific programming languages, tools, and techniques. It's essential to carefully plan and execute each step to ensure the successful development and deployment of the SQL injection vulnerability scanner.
